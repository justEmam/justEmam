### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently self-learning Data Science/ML Algorithms.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord: Emam#7228 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm one of the fastest typists in the world, and the fastest in Egypt.
 
You will mostly find me either problem-solving on codewars, or chilling on Discord. Very interested in the integration of AI with Chemical Engineering (for now), I see major potential in the integration of these two.

Currently working on automating the steam tables of thermodynamics and developing other CHE related tools.
